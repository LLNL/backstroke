V2.1.2  2018-02-06 Markus Schordan <schordan1@llnl.gov>
	* Added statistics for generation of reversible default assignment
	  operators (option --stats)
	* Fixed crashing statistics report on cout (option --stats)
	* Fixed ROSE version check.
	* Removed comment in generated code.
V2.1.1  2017-08-21 Markus Schordan <schordan1@llnl.gov>
	* updated to ROSE version 0.9.9.87 (C++ frontend EDG 4.12 and use
	  of new namespace 'Rose')
	* fixed pre-processor status message to be only printed when
	  requested with option --status.

V2.1.0  2017-03-15 Markus Schordan <schordan1@llnl.gov>
	* public release

V2.0.16 2016-09-30 Markus Schordan <schordan1@llnl.gov>
	* refined ROSS support (this version allows to run the KMC
	  model in optimistic pdes mode with C++ STL).
	* added new C++11 container tests with template specialization to test
	  forward/reverse/commit after each operation.
	* added C++11 STL tests (passing for all STL containers (except valarray))
	* added support for C++11 STL containers
	* added support for switching between recording and not recording
	  of data for reversibility. This allows to share a type in
	  reversible and non-reversible code sections.
	* removed the generation of namespaces (this simplifies the use of
	  Backstroke)

V2.0.15 2016-07-08 Markus Schordan <schordan1@llnl.gov>
	* added exception handling (Backstroke::Exception) to the
	  Backstroke runtime library. For every detected error an exception of
	  this type is thrown.
	* added test for Backstroke::Exception.
	* Changed STL tests to use EDG C pre-processor.
	* removed use of iostream from Backstroke library.
 	* removed functions initializeEvent and finalizeEvent
	  (using beginEvent, endEvent instead now).

V2.0.14 2016-06-17 Markus Schordan <schordan1@llnl.gov>
	* made --access-mode=1 the default (before it was --access-mode=2)
	* added xpdes interface to the Backstroke library and a new mode
  	  to generate calls to the xpdes interface in transformed code.
	* updated documentation to reflect the changes in the code
	  transformations and descriptions.
	* adapted all tests to use xpdes mode.
	* bugfix: copy assignment operator generation for class data
	  members of type multi-dimensional array, defined using typedefs
	  for different dimensions (reported by Euna Kim)
	* added new tests for multi-dimensional C arrays

V2.0.13 2016-05-13 Markus Schordan <schordan1@llnl.gov>
	* this version allows to use generated code without wrapping it
	  into a namespace.
	* added new information recording mode, allowing to select
	  reversibility at run time.
	* refinement of assignment operator generation (avoiding to
	  conflict with existing non-default assignment operators with the
	  same function signature but different return type)
        * bugfix: placement new
	* refined stl-list test to use new mode and all STL headers.
	* removed command line options namespace,
	  eliminate-global-operator-decls, duplicate.
	* renamed namespace singleton to xpdes (preparation for xpdes
	  interface).

V2.0.12 2016-03-16 Markus Schordan <schordan1@llnl.gov>
	* added generation of reversible default assignment operators
	* added generation of reversible default copy constructors
	* added new command line options
	  --namespace --no-namespace
	  --no-assign-op
	  --eliminate-global-operator-decls
	  --duplicate --no-duplicate
	  --copy-constr --no-copy-constr
	  --lib-header --no-lib-header
	  --opt-local-var --no-opt-local-var
	* improved runtime lib to provide all functions in header for inlining
	* bugfix: switched data queue ends for commit event
	* bugfix: support for delete and delete[] when applied to null pointer

V2.0.11 2015-12-03 Markus Schordan <schordan1@llnl.gov>
	* improved generic interface in backstroke library (access-mode=2)
	  to handle more C++ types.
	* added new command line options --duplicate, --namespace,
	  --eliminate-global-operator-decls, --lib-header
	* bugfix: removed redundant initialization of ROSE name qualification
	  (reported by Euna Kim and Jacob I. Sacks)

V2.0.10 2015-11-10 Markus Schordan <schordan1@llnl.gov>
	* added new backend feature to support templates
	* added new command line option --access-mode=arg to select different
	forms of Backstroke library API access in the generated code.
	* added command line option for computing transformation
	statistics and writing the results to a CSV file.
	* added generic interface(s) to the Backstroke library API
	* added stl tests (transformation and compile)

V2.0.9 2015-09-29 Markus Schordan <schordan1@llnl.gov>
	* bugfix: array allocation/deallocation in backstroke runtime library.

V2.0.8 2015-07-24 Markus Schordan <schordan1@llnl.gov>
	* Unified use of unparse functions for types and expressions.
	* bugfix: adapted code generation for unparsing of transformed
	'new' operator inside templates. In some cases the unparser
	entered an infinite loop (reported by Chris Hood). The unified use
	of code generation functions eliminates all those problematic
	cases.

V2.0.7 2015-06-25 Markus Schordan <schordan1@llnl.gov>
	* bugfix: runtimelib: callArrayElementDestructors. Fixed name of
	used template parameter (reported by Chris Hood).
	* bugfix: ensured that no digraph '<:' is present in generated
	code (reported by Chris Hood).
	* Added support for improved source code formatting.

V2.0.6 2015-06-17 Markus Schordan <schordan1@llnl.gov>
	* Refined support for backstroke directive '#pragma reverse
	exclude'
	* bugfix: added generation of missing cast in transformed forward
	code for returned values of avpushptr as required for expressions
	that perform pointer arithmetic (reported by Chris Hood).
	* Added test case for pointer arithmetic and reduced number of
	loops in runtime tests to reduce 'make check' time.

V2.0.5 2015-06-08 Markus Schordan <schordan1@llnl.gov>
	* Added backstroke directive '#pragma reverse exclude'
	* Adapted tests for more extensive memory allocation/deallocation
	and scaling evaluation.
	* Updated documentation with new directive.

V2.0.4 2015-05-13 Markus Schordan <schordan1@llnl.gov>
	* Changed callArrayElementDestructors signature and adapted
	generated code.
	* Added new options --access-operator-arrow and	--access-operator-dot
	* Added support for event record reuse memory allocation scheme
	* Changed init_stack_info to become a static function

V2.0.3 2015-05-03 Markus Schordan <schordan1@llnl.gov>
	* Added mechanism for reuse of EventRecords. The RTL can now also
	be initialized with the number of event records to be
	pre-allocated as parameter of the RunTimeStateStorage constructor.

V2.0.2 2015-04-03 Markus Schordan <schordan1@llnl.gov>
	* bugfix: handling of array element types of type
	class/struct/union in array memory allocation operations: the
	generated reinterpret-cast in the forward code now properly uses
	the correct class name in case an array element is of type
	class/struct/union.

V2.0.1 2015-02-23 Markus Schordan <schordan1@llnl.gov>
	* C-arrays: improved memory allocation/deallocation for C-arrays
	in case of rollbacks.

V2.0.0 2015-01-30 Markus Schordan <schordan1@llnl.gov>
	* initial version
